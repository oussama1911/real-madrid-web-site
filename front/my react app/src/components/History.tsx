                <div className='foundation'> On March 6, 1902, the Madrid Foot Ball Club is founded by a group of fans in Madrid, Spain. <br /> Later known as Real Madrid, the club would become the most successful European football (soccer) franchise of the 20th century. <br />

                    With its trademark blue-and-white uniforms (originally inspired by those of an English team), <br /> Madrid began to make a name for itself in Spain almost right away. From 1905 to 1908, with future coach Arthur Johnson on the roster, <br /> the team won four cup titles in a row. In 1932, Real Madrid won the first of (as of 2024) 36 championships in La Liga, <br /> the top Spanish soccer league, including an impressive five consecutive titles from 1986 to 1990. </div>

                        Real Madrid celebrates its 123rd anniversary. On 6 March 1902, the first Board of Directors of the Madrid Foot Ball Club was officially elected. <br /> That marked the beginning of the legend of the greatest club in the world. 123 years later, <br /> Real Madrid is a benchmark in world sport with a record 26 European Cups (15 in football and 11 in basketball) <br /> and is honoured to have been chosen by FIFA as the Best Club of the 20th Century.

In basketball, Madrid are the reigning league champions, <br /> having won their 37th title in the competition.
